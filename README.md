# Miscellaneous Math
TL;DR: Recrational math repo, don't actually use this.

## My life story
As a child, math fascinated me. I used to spend copious amounts of time in classes and weekend mornings scribbling down random mathematical formulae and sequences (mostly spontaneously "what if"s), and trying to find patterns in them. Some I could pretty confidently prove to myself, but for most of them, the tools to properly prove them were still beyond my level of comprehension. I could only verify, numerically, that the patterns held up against a small range of numbers I could compute. This repository is meant to be an archive of those formulae and sequences, written out in code so that they may be further verified and played around with (Sadly my 10 years of formal mathematical education plus watching random math videos has still left me ill-equipped, especially in number theory), along with some other formulae that I did not chance upon by myself, but just found pretty cool. All mathematical formulae in this repository are written in [AsciiMath syntax](http://asciimath.org/).

<b>This repository is not meant for any practical purpose.</b>
